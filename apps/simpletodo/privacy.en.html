<br/>
1. Purpose of Processing Personal Information<br/>
<br/>
The provider does not require any membership registration or provision of personal information, and no personal data of the user is sent outside of the user's device or collected.<br/>
<br/>
However, the Android Advertising ID, which is provided by the user for advertising and analytics purposes on Google Play, is provided to Google AdMob for in-app advertising and Google Firebase for analytics. The procedures and responsibilities for this are with Google AdMob and Google Firebase.<br/>
<br/>
The provider strictly adheres to Google Play's guidelines regarding the Advertising ID, and does not store or transmit this information within the app or to the provider's server.<br/>

2. Current Status of Personal Information Files<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We do not store or use cookies.<br/>
<br/>
However, information used by the store services and advertising services is accessed through the respective service's SDK. This information is not stored by us.<br/>
<br/>
If users have any questions regarding this, they should contact the respective services (Google and each advertising media) directly.<br/>
<br/>

Therefore, we do not have any content or retention period regarding the processing of users' personal information.<br/>

Our application is a standalone application that does not use separate servers.<br/>
